# ❓ FAQ

### 🔄 Verisoning :

The modpack uses a new version system: **Major.Minor.Patch**

-   Major : A new version of minecraft or a big modpack change, **these updates are not backwards compatible.**
-   Minor : New mods might have been added or removed, **read the changelogs to see if it's backwards compatible.**
-   Patch : Updated mods, safe to update worlds.

### 💻 System requirements:

With these specs I was able to achive an average of **60 fps**.

### 🟪 Why Quilt? :

They have a better website.

### 📊 Differences between BL:Classic and BL:Beyond:
Beyond has more mods and features. It is considered the succesor of classic. Main reason why this pack exists is Tectonic v2, when i started making the pack it was only availible on 1.20. I also needed a fresh start for my modpack, classic has way too many versions and changed way too much.
